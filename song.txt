Do you think about the days when we sat down
Smoking, wine and drinking haze or?
Was it the other way?
Was it the other way?

[Refrain]
Do you think about the days when we sat down
Smoking, wine and drinking haze or?
Was it the other way?
Was it the other way?
Swing around, come on, chill with me
I got your favorite show recorded on my TV, but
We don't have to watch that, no
I'll turn off the radio

[Verse]
So won't you pick up?
Then we can link up
It's not a hookup
Don't think about it too much, too much
You just need to pick up
Then we can link up
Don't think about it too much, too much

[Build]
Don't think about it too much, too much
Don't think about it too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, much, much, much
Do you think about the days when we sat down
Smoking, wine and drinking haze or?
Was it the other way?
Was it the other way?
Swing around, come on, chill with me
I got your favorite show rеcorded on my TV, but
We don't have to watch that, no
I'll turn off thе radio
